# EnviRoBot — Waste Classification Model

This repository contains the waste classification model used in the **EnviRoBot** project — an initiative aimed at automating waste identification using computer vision. The current model achieves an accuracy of **87.3%**, significantly improving upon earlier baselines.

---

## Objective

To accurately classify waste into categories such as plastic, metal, and glass using a deep learning model trained on image data. This classification module is part of a larger robotic system that identifies and collects waste from the environment.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** 87.3%  
- Trained on a labeled dataset of waste images  
- Can be integrated into UAV/UGV systems for real-time waste detection

---

## Future Scope

- Expand to more waste categories (e.g., organic, electronic)
- Deploy model on edge devices (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi)
- Integrate with robotic navigation and pickup modules
